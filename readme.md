**Ruby Cucumber Selenium-Webdriver Framework**

This is a Ruby, Cucumber, Selenium-Webdriver testing framework that I have build from scratch.

This framework is started from scratch but I'm hoping to have something very useful in the near features.

I'm hoping this is for both a testing framework and something I can use to teach others how to automate in Ruby.

Run "$ bundle install" to install the gem files

To run the automation run the following command:

"$ bundle exec cucumber features/test.feature"
